# **Our Story**

The number one issue musicians have in this day and age is the oversaturation of the entire music industry. Every indie musician struggles to stand out from their music alone, yet, many people have the desire to make it big. We are also existing in a time where every form of work by these musicians that is capable of being loitered to the general public on a physical level, has now gone out of fashion and usability.  This is where SoundCandy comes in.

 

SoundCandy is the first musician oriented DeFi and NFT combined CEX-DEX, with a community that is solely dedicated to maintain the project. Community members will have absolute authority over major decisions, bug fixes and recommendations. The developer team is simply there to make those changes!


## **How does the DAO work?**

The foundation of SoundCandy is designed to function as a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). This means that the main developer renounces their ownership of the token and the community, leaving holders a foundation to flourish from. There will be interaction still between the developers and community, however they will not make personal decisions FOR the community. This leaves responsibility and free will for everyone involved to see through the future of the project!

## **Our End Goal**

We have a lot of big plans that can be found in the road map and whitepaper, but overall, SoundCandy is meant to give musicians a safe and reliable community, where they feel they have the power to make their future predictable. This is just the beginning!
